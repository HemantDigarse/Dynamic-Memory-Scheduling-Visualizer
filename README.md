# Dynamic-Memory-Scheduling-Visualizer
#Overview

The Dynamic Memory Scheduling Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates how memory is allocated and scheduled dynamically in an operating system. It provides users with a visual representation of memory allocation techniques, scheduling algorithms, and real-time interactions to understand memory management principles.
#Features:
    * Dynamic Memory Allocation Visualization: Illustrates how memory blocks are allocated and freed.

   * Scheduling Algorithms: Supports different scheduling policies like First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin.
      
   * Real-Time Interaction: Allows users to input processes, define memory size, and observe the execution dynamically.

   * Performance Metrics: Displays execution time, memory utilization, and process turnaround time.

   * User-Friendly UI: Provides an intuitive and interactive interface.

#Technologies Used:

   * Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

   * Backend (if applicable): Node.js, Express.js

   * Visualization Libraries: D3.js or Chart.js

#Installation:
   * Visual Studio Code

#Usage

  * Open the application in a browser.

  * Enter process details such as arrival time, burst time, and memory size.

  * Choose a scheduling algorithm.

  * Start the simulation and observe the memory allocation and scheduling.

  * Analyze the performance metrics displayed.
